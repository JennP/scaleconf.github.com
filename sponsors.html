              We&#8217;re trying to make this event as accessible as possible in order to promote the best practices and technologies that will help drive
              a world-class DevOps culture here in South Africa. For this to happen, we need some help. We aren&#8217;t offering packages to sponsors but
              would rather engage each sponsor personally to arrange something beneficial for both parties. If you or your company are in a position to help 
              with funding, equipment, speakers, or anything else, please <a href='/contact-us'>get in touch with us.</a>
