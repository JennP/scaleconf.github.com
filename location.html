                  <h6 style='color:#555'>Transport in Cape Town</h6>
                  <p>
                    South Africa has a good long-distance bus system, but using airlines to travel between major cities is recommended due to the time and distance (and better quality of travel). If you do want to go the more 
                    scenic route, you can try one of the many bus companies: <a href='http://greyhound.co.za'>Greyhound</a>, <a href='http://translux.co.za'>Translux</a> and <a href='http://intercape.co.za'>Intercape</a>. If you'd prefer the backpacker 
                    style of getting around the country, you might want to check out <a href='http://bazbus.com'>Bazbus</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once in Cape Town, you can get around using the relatively new <a href='http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/MyCiti/'>MyCiti</a> bus system, or you can use one of the many taxi companies. If you are going to
                    use taxis, we recommend <a href='http://excitetaxis.co.za'>Excite Taxis</a>, or <a href='http://www.rikkis.co.za/'>Rikkis</a>.

                  <p>
                    We&#8217;ll give you more information on accommodation when we&#8217;ve finalised the venue.

                  <h6 style='color:#555'>Organised events</h6>
                  <p>
                    We&#8217;re still in the planning stages, but there will definitely be social events and a hackathon.  We&#8217;re also looking at organising wine-tasting and a trip to see the penguins in the days following the conference.
