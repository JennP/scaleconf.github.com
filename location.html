                  <h6 style='color:#555'>Transport in Cape Town</h6>
                  <p>
                    South Africa has a good long-distance bus system however, it's recommended to use flying to get around the country due to the time and distance (and better quality of travel). 
                    Bus companies include <a href='greyhound.co.za'>Greyhound</a>, <a href='translux.co.za'>Translux</a> and <a href='intercape.co.za'>Intercape</a>. If you'd prefer the backpacker 
                    style of getting around the country, you might want to check out <a href='bazbus.com'>Bazbus</a>.

                    Once in Cape Town, you can get around using the relatively new <a href='http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/MyCiti/'>MyCiti</a> bus system, or you can use one of the many taxi companies. If you are going to
                    use taxi's, we recommend <a href='excitetaxis.co.za'>Excite Taxis</a>, or <a href='http://www.rikkis.co.za/'>Rikki's</a>.
